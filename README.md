#JS-Star-Parallax

##Star Field parallax effect w/ HTML5 canvas

Creates a pure-JavaScript star field parallax effect for your canvas game.

Change the `numBgLayers` and `baseStarNum` values in the `Demo` function for more parallax layers and stars. There is a performance hit after 20-or-so layers (stars become to small to see on average monitors after this number anyway). Working on the most efficient solution.

First working example on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/ikradex/BU32R/1/).
